    "`statsmodels` is far more than a linear regression powerhouse. It is also capable of fitting a range of *generalised* linear models, that allow users to fit models to non-normal data, such as binary, count, hierarchical models, and generalised estimating equations. We will explore some of these using the in-built datasets from `statsmodels`. These are located under the **non-formula** import of the package, which exposes a far wider range of functions outside of the nice formula interface we have seen so far."

    "### Logistic Regression\n",
    "We will first explore the use of logistic regression, which allows for the modelling of binary data - such as whether a trial was correct/incorrect, a participant was male/female, and so on. For this example we will use the [RAND Health Insurance Experiment data](http://www.rand.org/health/projects/hie.html) which contains a set of variables related to health insurance claims that have been used to investigate key questions in health insurance. The variables are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `mdvis` - Number of outpatient visits to an MD\n",
    "- `lncoins` - ln(coinsurance + 1), 0 <= coninsurance <= 10\n",
    "- `idp` - 1 if individual deductible plan, 0 otherwise\n",
    "- `lpi` - ln(max(1, annual participation incentive payment)\n",
    "- `fmde` - 0 if idp = 1; ln(max(1, MDE/(0.01 coinsurance))) otherwise\n",
    "- `physlm` - 1 if the person has a physical limitation\n",
    "- `disea` - number of chronic disease\n",
    "- `hlthg` - 1 if self-rated health is good\n",
    "- `hlthf` - 1 if self-rated health is fair\n",
    "- `hlthp` - 1 if self-rated health is poor\n",
    "\n",
    "We will attempt a simple logistic regression model, predicting whether someone has an individual deductible plan, `idp` (coded as 1 if yes, and zero if no) from a few predictors - number of chronic diseases `disea`, number of outpatient visits `mdvis`, and coinsurance, the amount that has to be paid if a claim is made, `lncoins`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fit logistic regression models, we can use the `logit` function from the formula `smf` interface, and specify our model with a formula string. But first we load the data (with a slightly unusual syntax) from the non-formula interface:"

    "Success! But what does all this mean? Logistic regression isn't as easy to interpret as ordinary least squares, where a single unit increase in the predictor is associated with a coefficient-value change in the outcome. Logistic regression actually models the *probability* of a positive/yes/one response in the outcome variable, but does so using the **logistic function**, which maps probability space, which is zero to one, to an infinite continuous space of positive and negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way it does this is by converting probabilities to odds, and then taking the logarithm of the odds - the log-odds. All coefficients in logistic regression represent the change in the log-odds of the outcome with a one-unit increase of the predictor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to clear this up by looking at the model. The `mdvis` predictor shows a significant, negative relationship with the outcome on the log-odds scale. We have no idea what this means outside of that when the number of visits go up, the probability of having a deductible plan goes down. But if we *exponentiate* the coefficient, we undo the logarithm and get the odds back, which are somewhat more interpretable. `numpy` can help us here!"

    "Though not encountered too often in psychological science, data that are distributed as counts are popular across other fields and are becoming more popular in research. Count data represent data that are coded as whole numbers (integers) that start at zero and have no upper limit. Normal regression models like ordinary least squares may make negative count predictions, or fractional predictions, which make little sense (what does it mean to have, say, negative counts of a behaviour, or 2.31201 instance of a behaviour?).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, count data can be modelled relatively simply with either a $Poisson$ or $Negative Binomial$ regression. These models are named after the distributions of the same name which describe the probability of count data. The Poisson is a straightforward single-parameter distribution that describes distributions of counts. The single parameter is sometimes called the 'rate', and it represents the average of all the count data in a Poisson distribution. So while the Poisson distribution produces whole-integer values, its parameter can be a continuous (positive!) value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The negative binomial is traditionally used to describe the probability of observing a number of failures before a single success - e.g. how many times must I roll a dice *before* I get a 3? The number of 'fails' (roll != 3) would be modelled by the negative binomial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the single-parameter Poisson does a good enough job in regression contexts. However sometimes we encounter a phenomenon called *over-dispersion*, which is where the variability of the counts exceeds the average tendency. Fortunately, the negative binomial can be used instead, as it allows for a second parameter to incorporate the variability. \n",
    "\n",
    "If this sounds too technical, don't worry - it really is. The details are not vital; what we need to focus on is if we are dealing with count data, we can start with the Poisson model, check for this overdispersion, and if it appears, switch to the negative binomial."

    "Not great, sadly. The model is really under-predicting - the observed data goes from 0 to 77, but the predictions only top 20. Is our data over-dispersed? We can check this, but it involves a little manual calculation - nothing too bad, though. First we take the models *Pearson residuals*, square them, and sum them. Then we divide this by the residual degrees of freedom of the model. If the result is greater than 1, we have evidence of overdispersion and should switch our modelling strategy.\n"

    "The interpretation of the coefficients is much the same as the Poisson regression case, with the estimates representing the change in the log-counts of the outcome variable with a one-unit change in the predictor variable. Exponentiating them casts them on an odds scale. \n",

    "You may notice the model seems to have an extra estimate - `alpha` - that also has a significance test associated with it. This is the **overdispersion parameter**. Recall that the Poisson distribution has a single parameter, the 'rate', or average. If the counts vary a lot, the Poisson will find it difficult to model the variability with a single parameter. The negative binomial distribution has a similar rate or average, but also has an additional parameter, alpha, which controls the variability of the counts. The model tests whether this value is significantly different from zero, which seems to be the case here. It's another way of examining over-dispersion! Interestingly, if this parameter equals zero, the model is mathematically equivalent to a Poisson regression."
